Largest Triple Products

You're given a list of n integers arr[0..(n-1)]. You must compute a list output[0..(n-1)] such that, for each index i (between 0 and n-1, inclusive), output[i] is equal to the product of the three largest elements out of arr[0..i] (or equal to -1 if i < 2, as arr[0..i] then includes fewer than three elements).

Note that the three largest elements used to form any product may have the same values as one another, but they must be at different indices in arr.

Signature

int[] findMaxProduct(int[] arr)

Input

n is in the range [1, 100,000].

Each value arr[i] is in the range [1, 1,000].

Output

Return a list of n integers output[0..(n-1)], as described above.

Example 1

n = 5

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

output = [-1, -1, 6, 24, 60]

The 3rd element of output is 3*2*1 = 6, the 4th is 4*3*2 = 24, and the 5th is 5*4*3 = 60.

Example 2

n = 5

arr = [2, 1, 2, 1, 2]

output = [-1, -1, 4, 4, 8]

The 3rd element of output is 2*2*1 = 4, the 4th is 2*2*1 = 4, and the 5th is 2*2*2 = 8.

**INSTRUCTIONS:**

Fork this repo to your own. Create a solution to the problem. The test cases will prove whether your solution is correct.


**MY IDE IS THROWING ERRORS WHEN FIRST LOADING THIS CODE**

That's right. It's incomplete. Its your job to fill in the blanks.

**WHY DOES THIS README LOOK TERRIBLE**
fine. do a fork/ readme fix up / PR to here and I'll accept it.
